## Background

-   Emotion regulation is increasingly being studied within forensic psychological research
-   Robust associations are found between ER and aggression[^1] and a variety of externalizing behaviors including intimate partner violence, substance abuse and psychopathy
-   ER is now considered to be an evidence based dynamic risk factor for sexual reoffending[^2]

[^2]: [Seto et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37951100/)

## Background continued

-  While the evidence-base for ER as a clinical construct of interest in forensic psychology has grown, debate has persisted as [to what constitutes ER](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352250X15001141).

-  [Previous systematic reviews](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34436940/) of ER within child and adolescent samples has found great heterogeniety in how ER is measured and less then half of the 87 measures identified where judged to be psychometrically sound.

## Aim 

Review how emotion regulation is measured and conceptualized across forensic settings and how well identified measures perform in terms of reliability and validity.

## Method {.smaller}

-   A search strategy was designed similar to previous systematic reviews and meta-analysis (e.g. [Aldao et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20015584/), [Sloan et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28941927/)) which was published at [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42023495577) in December 2023

-   We coded which measures were used to measure ER as well as;

    -   which variables were measured conjointly with ER
    -   and how well measures of ER correlated with such variables and
    -   which reliability estimates that were reported for each ER measure.

## Discussion points {data-transition="zoom"}

1. Reliability

2. Measurement issues

3. Conceptual issues

## Reliability {data-transition="zoom"}

-   Reliability needs to be consistently reported for each sample and at the appropriate level of analysis.

-   Amongst the 59 studies included in the review, only 64% reported reliability estimates for their specific sample.

-   Reliability needs to be viewed in light of theoretical considerations.

## Measurement issues {data-transition="zoom"}

-   Choosing a measurement model is also embracing a specific theoretical model of the construct being measured.

-   Few measures of ER have been psychometrically evaluated within a forensic setting.

-   Measures of ER vary greatly in terms of:

    -   conceptual scope
    -   which emotions are being regulated
    -   which strategies that are being assessed

## Conceptual issues

-   The concept of ER had to be inferred based on the measurement model. The concept of ER was rarely explicitly outlined.

-   Conceptual differences exist between measures as to which strategies that are assumed to be adaptive and maladaptive respectively.

## Limitations

-   Validity was assessed in terms of correlations and we aggregated across operationalizations

-   It is possible that studies were overlooked that did not specifically discuss their results in relation to emotion regulation

-   Although two authors screened the studies, only one extracted data.
